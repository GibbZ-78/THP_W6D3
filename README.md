# THP W6D3 - The Return of the revenge of the Gossip Project !

Things you may want to cover:

* Migrations, schema, seeds (WiP) and related SQL script (to delete table content easily despite constraints) - See /db/

* Corresponding models and relations - See /app/models/ 

* Configuration (incl. routes, database.yml initialized with PostegreSQL...) - See /related files in the /config/ directory

* Controllers - See /app/controllers/

* Views and layouts - See /app/views/ sub-directories. In particular, /app/views/layout/ gathers the header / footer stuff

Enjoy, _wanderer_ :wink: !
